# Testing Real DistilBERT Model Loading

The system now supports loading actual DistilBERT models at runtime from various sources.

## Available Models

The system provides three model options:

1. **Full DistilBERT** (~250MB)
   - Source: `https://huggingface.co/Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased/resolve/main/onnx/model.onnx`
   - Best quality, slower inference
   - Full precision weights

2. **Quantized DistilBERT** (~65MB) **[Recommended]**
   - Source: `https://huggingface.co/Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased/resolve/main/onnx/model_quantized.onnx`
   - Good quality, faster inference
   - INT8 quantized weights

3. **Local Model**
   - Source: Local files in `/public/` directory
   - For custom trained models

## Testing Steps

1. **Access the Application**
   - Open http://localhost:5173
   - The system will start with the quantized model

2. **Test Model Selection**
   - Use the "Model Selection" dropdown to choose different models
   - Select backend (WebGPU/WebAssembly/Mock)
   - Click "Switch Model" to download and load

3. **Test Real Model Features**
   ```javascript
   // Try these test texts once real model is loaded:
   
   // Technical content
   "I need to debug this Python function that's throwing a TypeError"
   
   // Meeting content  
   "Let's schedule a team meeting for next Monday at 2 PM"
   
   // Email content
   "Please reply to my email about the project timeline"
   ```

4. **Verify Model Caching**
   - Switch models and observe download progress
   - Switch back - should load from cache instantly
   - Use "Clear Model Cache" to test re-downloading

## Model Loading Flow

1. **Automatic Fallback Chain**:
   ```
   Real Model (ONNX) â†’ Mock Model (if download fails)
   ```

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Models cached in browser's Cache API
   - Persistent across sessions
   - Manual cache clearing available

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Real-time download progress
   - Stage-by-stage loading status
   - Error handling with fallbacks

## Expected Behavior

**With Real Model:**
- More accurate embeddings
- Realistic classification performance  
- Proper tokenization handling
- ~1-2 second initial load time

**Download Times:**
- Quantized model: ~30-60 seconds (depending on connection)
- Full model: ~2-4 minutes
- Subsequent loads: <1 second (cached)

## Browser Compatibility

**For Real Models:**
- Chrome/Edge 113+: WebGPU + WASM
- Firefox/Safari: WASM only
- All browsers: Automatic fallback to mock if needed

## Troubleshooting

1. **Download Fails**: Check internet connection, CORS issues
2. **Model Won't Load**: Browser may lack WebAssembly support
3. **Out of Memory**: Try quantized model instead of full model
4. **Slow Performance**: Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled

## Production Notes

For production deployment:
- Host models on your CDN for better performance
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Consider model versioning and updates
- Monitor cache sizes and implement cleanup policies
